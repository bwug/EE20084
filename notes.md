Python is an interpreted, high level language. Interpreted means that the source code is processed into machine code at the point of operation. The alternative is compiled languages, where the source code must be compiled / converted into a processor specfic machine code executable before it may be used.

High-level means that there is a strong abstraction between the programming syntax or language used, and that of the underlying processor operation itself. It is usually more reader friendly at the cost of potential optimisations.
