<h1> EE20084 Structured Programming labwork </h1>

This module is about structured programming in Python and developing simulation software to assist in calculating recursive circuits

The module itself is seen as an introduction to python, but more advanced techniques like error handling and OOP will be used throughout to assist in code readability and functionality

Throughout the coding portions of this module, I will be using VSCode with a line ruler of 80 character, which is why the commenting style changes frequently
